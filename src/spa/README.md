# React/Sass/Redux Boilerplate

Boilerplate and guide for a React/Sass/Redux build.

## Getting Started

To get started, first install all the necessary dependencies.
```
> npm install
```

Run an initial webpack build
```
> webpack
```

It might be the case that you have installed webpack locally and received a __webpack command not recognized__ error. In such scenarios, you can either install webpack globally or run it from local installation by using the following command:

```
node_modules\.bin\webpack
```

Start the development server (changes will now update live in browser)
```
> npm run start
```

To view your project, go to: [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/)

## Reference

The boilerplate code mostly taken from the [React-Redux-Boilerplate](https://github.com/buckyroberts/React-Redux-Boilerplate) repository.
