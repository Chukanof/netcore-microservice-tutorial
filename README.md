# netcore-microservice-tutorial
This repo contains some very basic code sample that demonstrates one way of designing  micro-services, using .net core web api supported by akka.net and running on a Docker Swarm cluster, traffic controlled by an nginx proxy.


### Purpose
This demo is prepared for a personal talk. But my intention is to take it to a good shape overtime that can illustrate/visualize micro-service architectures running on container clusters. Any remarks..? Please reach out! Thanks
